# myEnglish

This is _Zhenkang_[^1]'s English learning footprint.

Now, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Tsinghua University, China. Until recently, I have realised English is the window to the colorful world and I totally haven't open it.So, I decided to do something to re-understand the world.

## Some resources on the internet

In China, there are so many resources helping people to pass the _IELTS_[^2]. Among them, excellent learning materials and methods are posted on the internet.

I have chosen some materials to train my skills of Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.

## My daily English

To improve programming skills and seek employment in the future, I have been solving the _[LeetCode](https://github.com/qizhenkang/myLeetCode)_ everyday problem. Similarly, I think it also helpful to practice English every day. So, the daily English training are recorded here.
