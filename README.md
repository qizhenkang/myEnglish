# myEnglish

This is _Zhenkang_[^1]'s English learning footprint.

Until recently, I have not realized English is the window to the colorful world and I haven't totally open it.
So, I decided to do something to re-understand the world.

## Some resources on the internet

In China, there are so many resources helping people to pass the _IELTS_[^2]. Among them, excellent learning materials and methods are posted on the internet.

I have chosen some materials to train my skills of Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.

## My daily English

**Small changes make a huge difference.** To improve programming skills and seek employment in the future, I have been solving the _[LeetCode](https://github.com/qizhenkang/myLeetCode)_ daily challenge.
Similarly, I think it also helpful to practice English every day.
So, the daily English studying is recorded here.

### Basic sentence pattern

There are 18 basic sentence patterns as a tutorial for English writing.

## Stories & Ideas

To achieve the goal above, I'd like to write something everyday. It may be a short story or a sparkle idea.

### My story

In Tsinghua, people focus on the story of an star professor or an excellent student, while a large number of those of the ordinary are ignored. Therefore, I have no choice but to put my story and idea here.

I'm born in a _rural_[^4] area of China, where I had a happy childhood. Working hard and _showing perseverance_ in high school, I luckily had the access to almost the best _tertiary education_ in China. Currently, I'm _pursuing_ the Ph.D. degree in Tsinghua University, China.

A little bit unfortunately, to chase fame and fortune, my professor in Tsinghua usually asks me to do many non-academic affairs and there is **little academic guidance** for me.
In fact, the quality of academic guidance from professor does _make a huge difference to_ postgraduates' _academic performance_ and _job prospects_.

My time for study and research is fragmentary, which is the reason why you could see this page.

<!-- ### About China

I'd like to write something about my motherland, China, from the perspective of a native resident. -->

#### Developing

Low-cost university education _makes it possible_ for students from less well-off backgrounds to _have equal access_ to _tertiary education_.
_Online shopping_ has become a normal part of many students' everyday life.

#### However

However, Chinese society is becoming _highly competitive_ nowadays.
The _ageing population_ and _soaring_ income gap make students feel under increasing pressure to study hard.

<!-- ### Why is English so significant for non-native English people  -->

<!-- show perseverance -->

<!-- make a decent living -->
