# myEnglish

This is _Zhenkang_[^1]'s English learning footprint.

Now, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Tsinghua University, China.
Until recently, I have not realised English is the window to the colorful world and I haven't totally open it.
So, I decided to do something to re-understand the world.

## Some resources on the internet

In China, there are so many resources helping people to pass the _IELTS_[^2]. Among them, excellent learning materials and methods are posted on the internet.

I have chosen some materials to train my skills of Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.

## My daily English

To improve programming skills and seek employment in the future, I have been solving the _[LeetCode](https://github.com/qizhenkang/myLeetCode)_ daily challenge. Similarly, I think it also helpful to practice English every day. So, the daily English studying is recorded here.

## Life in English

In general, people focus on the story of a star such as an star professor or an excellent student, while a large number of stories of the normal are ignored. Therefore, I have to put my story here.
