# myEnglish

This is _Zhenkang_[^my]'s English learning footprint.

Until recently, I have not realized English is the window to the colorful world and I haven't totally open it.
So, I decided to do something to re-understand the world.

## Some resources on the internet

In China, there are so many resources helping people to pass the _IELTS_[^ielts]. Among them, excellent learning materials and methods are posted on the internet.

In the area of Artificial Intelligence, _TRAINING_ may be one of the most famous and interesting. If you have enough _DATA_, you could train a perfect model by some advanced algorithms.

Therefore, I have chosen some learning materials(DATA) as input to train myself, to improve the Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking abilities.
Similarly, words on this github page is the output of my brain _model_.

## My daily English

**Small changes make a huge difference.** To improve programming skills and seek employment in the future, I have been solving the _[LeetCode](https://github.com/qizhenkang/myLeetCode)_ daily challenge.
Similarly, I think it also helpful to practice English every day.
So, the daily English studying is recorded here.

### Vocabulary.com

I stumbled upon the [Vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/), which is a intelligent website to help to improve vocabulary.

## Stories & Ideas

To achieve the goal above, I'd like to write something everyday. It may be a short story or a sparkle idea.

### My story

In Tsinghua, people focus on the story of an star professor or an excellent student, while a large number of those of the ordinary are ignored. Therefore, I have no choice but to put my story and idea here.

I'm born in a _rural_[^vocabulary] area of China, where I had a happy childhood. Working hard and _showing perseverance_ in high school, I luckily had the access to almost the best _tertiary education_ in China. Currently, I'm _pursuing_ the Ph.D. degree in Tsinghua University, China.

A little bit unfortunately, to chase fame and fortune, my professor usually asks me to do many non-academic affairs and there is **little academic guidance** for me.
In fact, the quality of academic guidance from professor does _make a huge difference to_ postgraduates' _academic performance_ and _job prospects_.
It is a _nightmare_ for me.

My time for study and research is fragmentary, which is the reason why you could see this page.

<!-- ### About

I'd like to write something about my life, from the perspective of a native resident. -->

## Life

Low-cost university education _makes it possible_ for students from less well-off backgrounds to _have equal access_ to _tertiary education_.
_Online shopping_ has become a normal part of many students' everyday life.

#### Some troubles

There is good and bad in everything. However, I habitually think about the bad side of things.

However, our society is becoming _highly competitive_ nowadays.
The _ageing population_ and _soaring_ income gap make students feel under increasing pressure to study hard.

<!-- ### Why is English so significant for non-native English people  -->

<!-- show perseverance -->

<!-- make a decent living -->
